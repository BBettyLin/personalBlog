# Introduction

In this blog post I will be writing about my reflections on the process of creating a Research Paper on Machine Learning in Computing Science Studio 2 **(41079)**. I will be working in a group for this project, we will be self-studying the python language in order to build the deep neural network required for this project. I'm excited to see how we will work as a group and what we will be able to produce.

## Addressing the situation

Unfortunately, due to COVID-19, on campus classes have been suspended. However, I do respect this decision as it was done to ensure the safety of staff, students and the general public but it does now come as a challenge to my group and I. 

Adjusting to both online work, virtual classes and meeting online for group meetings will prove challenging.
