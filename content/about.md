# What is there to know?

My name is Betty Lin and I am currently a student studying at the University of Technology Sydney (UTS). I enjoy creating things, have a passion for cyber and am always looking to expand and grow my skills in coding.

When I'm not building up my skills, I enjoy drawing, playing games and collecting stationery! 

My immediate future dream is to be able to be fully confident in my skills in coding and creating projects. (Baby steps!) 

For the further future, I would like to be doing something in STEM that will impact peoples lives in a positive way.
