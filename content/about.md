# A little about me

My name is Betty Lin and I am currently a student studying at the University of Technology Sydney (UTS). I enjoy creating things, and have a passion for cyber but I am always looking to expand and grow my skills in coding.

When I'm not building up my skills, I enjoy drawing, playing games and collecting stationery! 

My future dream is to be able to be fully confident in my skills in coding and creating projects. (Baby steps!)
